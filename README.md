# HelperNode v2

HelperNode v2 is built on all services running in a container and the end user interacts with them via a CLI utility (`helpernodectl`).

The basic principals are

* Declarative approach to running the services (configuration used as `helpernode.yaml`)
* All services are ephemeral and should not require binding to local storage
* All or only a subset of services can be used at the user's descretion.


# Alpha Build

This is an alpha and things are constantly changing. Please see our [official documentation site](https://redhatofficial.github.io/ocp4-helpernode) for full details
