# How to test this image

> You need to run this as `root` because of the port

Build it

```shell
podman build -t test-dns .
```

Get sample `vars.yaml` file.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/ocp4-helpernode/helperpod/vars.yaml -O /tmp/vars.yaml
```
Run it


```shell
podman run -id -e=HELPERPOD_CONFIG_YAML=$(base64 -w0 < /tmp/vars.yaml) --net host --name=test-dns test-dns
```

Check the yaml

```shell
podman exec -it test-dns cat /usr/local/src/helperpod.yaml
```

Check the config(s)

```shell
podman exec -it test-dns cat /etc/named.conf
podman exec -it test-dns cat /var/named/zonefile.db
podman exec -it test-dns cat /var/named/reverse.db
```

You can check the entries

> Make sure port 53/udp is open using `firewall-cmd`

```shell
dig @localhost master0.ocp4.example.com +short
```

Have a look around

```shell
podman exec -it test-dns bash
```

## Troubleshooting

You may need to run this if you're testing on Fedora Desktop (other services that may listen on 53)

```shell
systemctl stop dnsmasq
pkill dnsmasq
systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```
